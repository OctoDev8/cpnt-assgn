Clone the repo to your local machine by copying the link of my public repo under the green code button or here.
Using the link, put into your command line with git bash: **git clone <https://github.com/OctoDev8/cpnt-assgn.git>**

2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or fix by using **git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name** which also checks out the new branch you created. You can also use **git branch feature/your-feature-name**.

If applicable, add tests for your changes to ensure everything works as expected.

5. Push from your branch

Push your changes from your branch using **git push origin feature/your-feature-name**
