# Who am I?

I am a goal-oriented individual that works hard to accomplish their visions with the mentality that adversities are stepping blocks for future success in any field of career or life. I am highly curious and eager to attain any knowledge regardless of its applicability in the present moment, I believe that there will always be a time where they interweave. Thus, the interwoven knowledge creates potential to progress in unexpected ways for anything. As such, I am an open-minded and flexible individual willing to learn both principled or unorthodox concepts to improve myself. Regardless of what I do, that is what I am and these are my core beliefs.
